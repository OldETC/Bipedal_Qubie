Prototype small (40" tall) humanoid robot
This robot is just for personal use, not commercial.  It is built from readily available hobby
electronics, hobby servos and the skeleton is 3D printed.  I have been working on it for quite a
while, but not accomplished much other than to get the basic robot built and standing on its
own.  I have gotten the  gazebo model complete, but not debugged or the driver code written yet.

The file include documentation for the electronics used, the servos, the OpenSCAD files for the skeleton, some documentation, and a bit of the test code for the robot.
